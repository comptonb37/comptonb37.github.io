Creating presentation using GitHub has been an experience in its own right. I liked how quickly we were able to transition through presentations because of how easily accessible the link to the presentation is. I also liked how easy it was to modify the source code to put exactly what we wanted on our slides where we wanted it for maximum comfort. A downside to this method of presenting, however, was that those who aren’t capable of typing quickly or finding the link in an efficient manner were often laughed at before their presentation and then the content may have been taken less seriously due to the bad first impression they made. Another downside is that everybody’s presentation looked similar because nobody wanted to take the time to figure out a new way to use the source code; they just sticked with the usual tried and true, and the presentations became somewhat bland as they went on. Regardless of these issues, I still think it’s a good idea in terms of efficiency to continue utilizing RawGit links to give presentations.
