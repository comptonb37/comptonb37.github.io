TL;DR: The damage plagiarism has done and will continue to do if people continue to be indifferent to it's consequences.

Common sense dictates that plagiarism is a quick, simple solution to accomplishing a task. It is much easier to take someone else's idea and branch off of it or copy it completely than to have to start from scratch and create your own work; this is a given. By focusing on the immediate payoff of plagiarism, people overlook the deeper problem within the matter. In the long run, one is robbing his of herself of their education, even though it's not in a classroom setting. One is effectively limiting his or her potential to create without the access to outer resources; this is also a given. Without the ability to create, one's ability to contribute to the greater good of society is trivial. The advent of plagiarism not only harms one's own ability to create, but it also reduces society's desire to create. If one knows his or her work is bound to be stolen and that he or she will not be credited for the good they attempted to do for society, their desire to continue creating new material will surely reduce; this too is a given! The fact that the good and bad sides of plagiarism are both "common knowledge" raises the following question: "Why do we continue to plagiarize other people's work?" I believe the answer to this question falls into the category of morality.
