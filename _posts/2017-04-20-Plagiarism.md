TL;DR: Plagiarism has done and will continue to do drastic damage to society if people remain indifferent to it's consequences.

Common sense dictates that plagiarism is a quick, simple solution to accomplishing a task. It is much easier to take someone else's idea and branch off of it or copy it completely than to have to start from scratch and create your own work; this is a given. By focusing on the immediate payoff of plagiarism, people overlook the deeper problem within the matter. In the long run, one is robbing his of herself of their education, even though it's not in a classroom setting. One is effectively limiting his or her potential to create without the access to outer resources; this is also a given. Without the ability to create, one's ability to contribute to the greater good of society is trivial. The advent of plagiarism not only harms one's own ability to create, but it also reduces society's desire to create. If one knows his or her work is bound to be stolen and that he or she will not be credited for the good they attempted to do for society, their desire to continue creating new material will surely reduce; this too is a given! The fact that the overwhelming negatives of plagiarism are "common knowledge" raises the following question: "Why do we continue to plagiarize other people's work?" I believe the answer to this question falls into the category of morality. If you have ever thought about plagiarizing one's work or even gone through with it, I'm sure that you've felt at least some sense of reluctance. Sometimes, though, one may feel their needs are more important than the betterment of the world around them, and this is where morality comes in. I've personally separated those people who don't feel remorse for their actions into three categories; personality traits if you will: those who are lazy, those who are selfish, and those who play off of learned helplessness.

Laziness is the most common of these traits and is a feeling we've all experienced at some point in our lives. There's guaranteed to be some time where we decide that we don't want to do something because we just don't feel like it; in the case of plagiarism, we don't want to create something new and would rather just take somebody else's idea and call it a day. I'm sure somebody at every school has done this and been called out for it but I don't believe it's looked down upon and shunned enough. This trait is the simplest to fix; we can enhance our schooling system so that it teaches from a very early age that laziness is not tolerable; they'd rather have nothing turned in than something that is not original. Schools claim that they do attempt to prevent it as best as possible, and while some do a splendid job of it, others may be slacking. Our view on plagiarism must be unanimously against it so that we can start taking action against it; we must instill its drawbacks into the minds of kids at an early age so their views will be impacted throughout the rest of their life. Some people, however, may not be as easily convinced that plagiarism is wrong.
