TL;DR: A commentary on the morality behind plagiarism, its consequences, and a proposal of a solution to the issue.

Common sense concludes that plagiarism is a quick, simple solution to accomplishing a task. It is much easier to take someone else's idea and branch off of it or copy it than to have to start from scratch and create your own work; this is a given. By focusing on the immediate payoff of plagiarism, people overlook the deeper problem within the matter. In the long run, one is robbing his of herself of their education, even though it's not in a classroom setting. One is effectively limiting his or her potential to create without the access to outer resources. Without the ability to create, one's ability to contribute to the greater good of society is trivial.
