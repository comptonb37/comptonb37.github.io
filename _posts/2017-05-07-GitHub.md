GitHub allows us users to easily share our work with anyone around the world in a mobile-ready fashion. It’s a great showcase of what modern technology is capable of; family members of mine would never have easy access to what I’m accomplishing on a day-to-day basis here. It also makes receiving feedback easier because you can simply send someone some editing suggestions for them to review later. This is much easier than calling someone and thinking you remembered what they said and then forgetting 5 seconds later. Markdown is also incredible in managing the formatting of your article. It may be hard to grasp and remember starting off, but once you get the hang of it, you may not ever want to use Microsoft Word again due to how much faster and more convenient it is. These two tools have changed how work is being shared, and they are bound to keep evolving, so I look forward to using whatever new tools they create in the future.
