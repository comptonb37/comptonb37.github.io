TL;DR: Super Metroid defined a new play-through method of gaming and has greatly impacted the lives of many both within the gaming community and around the world.

Gamers have always been about speed in games, but a game had never been made that seemed to be intricately designed to be ran through as quickly as possible. It wasn't until Deer Force created Super Metroid for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1994 that the gaming industry had changed. I remember watching my uncle play it when I was around 7 years old, and was terrified of its gloomy, lonesome atmosphere and tricky puzzles, so I never played it on my own. It wasn't until I rediscovered it in 2012 that my entire outlook on gaming changed.

In my first run of the game I figured that I could breeze through the game due to the fact that I was older and had more common sense, but I remember the exact spot I got stuck on, the "noob bridge" and is it now often referred to as. The protagonist Samus Aran has the ability to dash from the start of the game but I was unaware and could not figure out how to cross this obstacle. Frustrated after a half hour of trying, I googled for the solution, and found a community of people that had the same issue as me.
