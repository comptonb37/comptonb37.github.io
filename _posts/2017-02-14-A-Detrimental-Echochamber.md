TL;DR: TBD

YouTube is a great resource for many people around the world. We all have used it for the massive amount of videos uploaded by millions of people coming from a variety of backgrounds. These videos span over a wide variety of topics from how-to videos to music from a wide variety of genres, even videos showing and analyzing politics! These videos reach out to almost every audience, so everyone has a use of YouTube. The advent of YouTube has created a revolution of entertainment, but cannot say it doesn't have it downsides. YouTube has created an "echochamber" for people after one quick search, and pigeonholes users into viewing videos of similar topics that they've viewed before due to the "recommended videos" system of Google.

Every time you search a video, YouTube remembers it and attempts to give you videos of the same style in your recommended videos on the front page of the website. A prime example of this would be music. Let's say you have a strong liking for Beyonce and her music and constantly listen to her music. YouTube remembers this and spits out more videos from Beyonce's VEVO at you for you to watch. You may have a secret liking for country music you never knew about, but if you never search for it, YouTube doesn't prioritize showing you these videos unless they are trending. Even if you branch out to other styles of music, videos that you've watched time and time again will start showing up in the videos on the sidebar even if they have no relevance to the video you're watching. I personally found my favorite artist, Tori Kelly, through YouTube, but I only found her through her doing a cover of Michael Jackson's PYT. I would have never found her by myself if I didn't like the pop music she did a cover of, so the recommended section of YouTube almost ruined my chances of discovering my current favorite vocalist.

I have had similar experiences when watching videos of people playing video games. I find a lot of video games I like to play also fun to watch, and find new games to try through my favorite YouTubers. The only problem with this is that usually a YouTuber will stick to a game or style of game that they are good at so that they can maintain viewers and sponsorships. One of my favorite YouTubers, STAR_ or Ster, primarily plays first person shooters because of his skill in them. He is also a very funny guy; his sense of humor and comments on the game he is playing always make me laugh. He has made many videos on TF2 with his friends and some other random videos here and there, but he doesn't strive to branch out to games of other styles. Because I've watched his videos so many times, they often appear near the top of my recommended videos on the front page of YouTube. I remember how funny I thought one of his videos was or I see a new video of his, and I click on it. I keep watching videos of the same style over and over, and sometimes it gets boring, but YouTube offers no other recommended options of videos games besides first person shooters. I would love to find a YouTuber that consistently posts videos on some of my other favorite games, but YouTube has no knowledge of my liking of those games and will always remind of the same videos that I have watched in the past. This limits the ability for us gamers to branch out into others genres. This is not the fault of YouTube itself, but of the recommended videos system of YouTube that you see every time you open the website.
